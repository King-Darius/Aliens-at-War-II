# Third-party Assets

This directory only contains third-party content that is compatible with the project's MIT license.

The GPL-licensed **lo-th 3d.city** package has been purged from the repository and must not be reintroduced. Keeping GPLv3-licensed assets alongside the MIT codebase would obligate the entire project to adopt the GPL, so ensure any future additions here are reviewed for license compatibility.
